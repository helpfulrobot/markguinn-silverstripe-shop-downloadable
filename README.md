Downloadable Products Submodule
===============================
For Silverstripe Shop
---------------------

Allows Products and/or ProductVariations to have files attached
that the customer can download once the product has been purchased
and remain available on the user's account pages.


Requirements
------------
- Can be applied to a Product or ProductVariation or both (FAIL: ProductVariation is currently untested)
	* If a variation is purchased, all files from both variation and main product
	  become available for download. (FAIL)
- Any number and type of file can be associated with a Product
- Downloads are available immediately on receipt screen if paying by credit card
- Downloads are available on the order history
- All historical downloads are available from a central screen in the account area (FAIL)
- Can download files individually or any combination in a zip archive
	* We should keep the zip files around for a few days so we don't recreate them all the time
	* Cron job to delete old files
- Download links should not be guessable
- Download links should be different for each customer/order for the same file
- Downloads should be logged


Installation
------------
1. `composer require markguinn/silverstripe-shop-downloadable dev-master`
2. Add Downloadable extension to Product and/or ProductVariation or only to certain subclasses.
3. Run `dev/build?flush`
4. Go add some files in the CMS (each product will have a "Files" tab)

YML example:
```
Product:
  extensions:
    - Downloadable
ProductVariation:
  extensions:
    - Downloadable
```


File Download Process
---------------------
1. Once order is paid, files show up on the order screen. Links are generated by the Downloadable extension on
   the product.
2. The link a user clicks is something like "http://example.com/downloads/SHA1HASH", which hits the DownloadController.
	* Hash is repeatable given an order ID and file ID (so it will work in emails too)
	* This step could also include a form submission with multiple files.
3. DownloadController logs the download. If it's only for a single file and the file is small (default 10MB, but
   configurable via yml) it will just output the mime type and use fpassthru to immediately initiate the download. If there
   is more than one file or if it's a large file, a temporary "Please wait" page will be displayed while the file is copied
   and/or zipped if more than one.
    * The temporary file will be cached in such a way that it can be re-used until it is deleted by a cron job.
    * The text of the temporary page can be taken from any page in the CMS via yml config
    * If one wants to disable the "passthru" behaviour entirely it can be easily done by setting the "small file" limit to 0.
    * Can require a login if desired (via config)
4. If the temporary page is displayed, it will immediately redirect to another URL that will start the copy/zip task
5. When the copy/zip task is complete it will redirect to the actual url of the temporary file


TODO
----
- Verify works with ProductVariation
- Tests

Would be nice but I have no intention of doing the work myself anytime soon:
- Translatable
- Time limit on downloads
- Allow files to be hosted elsewhere? (CDN)
